              Milkha Singh (20 November 1929 â€“ 18 June 2021) also known as The
              Flying Sikh, was an Indian track and field sprinter who was
              introduced to the sport while serving in the Indian Army.

                He is the only athlete to win gold at 400 metres at the Asian
                Games as well as the Commonwealth Games. He also won gold medals
                in the 1958 and 1962 Asian Games.
              </li>
              <li>
                He represented India in the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne,
                the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome and the 1964 Summer Olympics in
                Tokyo.
              </li>
              <li>
                He was awarded the Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian
                honour, in recognition of his sporting achievements.
              </li>

                The race for which Singh was best remembered is his fourth-place
                finish in the 400 metres final at the 1960 Olympic Games, which
                he had entered as one of the favourites. He led the race till
                the 200m mark before easing off, allowing others to pass him.
                Various records were broken in the race, which required a
                photo-finish and saw American Otis Davis being declared the
                winner by one-hundredth of a second over German Carl Kaufmann.
                Singh's fourth-place time of 45.73 seconds was the Indian
                national record for almost 40 years.
